#summary Getting Started Quickly.

=== Setup your development environment ===

  * Download and install Eclipse.
  * Install the Eclipse GWT Plugin.
  * Create a new GWT Project.
  * Download and Configure GXT.
  * Download the latest stable EasyGWT Jar and add it to your project's class path.
  * Add : 

{{{
   <inherits name='com.emitrom.easygwt.wf.EasyGWT'/>
}}}

to your X.gwt.xml.

  * In your GWT project's entry point class, add:

{{{
   public void onModuleLoad() {
	ColumnViewPort columnView = ColumnViewPort.getInstance();
   }
}}}

  * Run your project.

=== Create Navigation items ===

   The Navigation Panel is composed of Parent Items. Each Parent represents an element in an Accordion Layout. Parents are composed consequently of children which will be represented under the parent by an icon and text.

{{{
List<ColumnNavigationParent> navigationParentsList = new ArrayList<ColumnNavigationParent>();
}}}

   As you would imaginate the List of navigation parents take a parent object as it's argument. See below:

{{{
		ColumnNavigationParent parent1 = new ColumnNavigationParent();
		parent1.setHeading(constants.parentOne());
		parent1.setIcon(AbstractImagePrototype.create(icons.chartBar()));
}}}

   In this case, we've created a Column Navigation Parent instance and set the heading as well as the icon that will be used when the application loads up.

   The next step is to simply add a child instance to the recently created parent. See below:

{{{
		ColumnNavigationChild parent1Child1 = new ColumnNavigationChild(injector.getMyView(), 
				constants.parentOneChildOne());
		parent1Child1.setIcon(icons.house());
		parent1.addNavigationChild(parent1Child1);
}}}

   You have the ability as in the parent case to set a heading as well as an icon for all children.

Lastly you simply add the list of navigation parents to the column instance obtained initially:

{{{
		columnView.addNavigationItems(navigationParentsList);
}}}
