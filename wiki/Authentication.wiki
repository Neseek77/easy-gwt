#summary Authentication

== Login Dialog ==

A Login Dialog is provided to aid the developer in the process of creating an authentication mechanism. The Login Dialog consists of:

a) A User Name field with a very simple email validator. This validator can be overridden by obtaining access to the field's instance and setting a new one.

b) A password field.

c) Validation is built in and the OK button will not be set to enabled until both User Name and Password fields have been filled out.

d) There are also two additional buttons that are hidden by default containing a "Forgot Password" button as well as a "Sign Up" button.

=== Authenticator Interface ===

The framework provides an Authenticator interface with the following methods:

{{{
	public void login();
	public void logout();
	public void onSuccess();
}}}
