#summary Wizard

Implementing a Wizard has never been easier. The Wizard consists of three main components all of which are depicted below:

  * Wizard Dialog.
  * Wizard Pages.
  * Wizard Model.

=== Wizard Dialog ===

The Wizard Dialog is the entry point to the creation of a new Wizard. A new instance can be obtained by:

{{{
   WizardDialog wizard = new WizardDialog() {
					
      @Override
      public void finish() {
         // Invoked when the user successfully completes all the Wizard Pages and clicks on
         // the Finish button.
      }
   }

}}}
